# Traffic Accident Prediction and Analysis

Analyzed real-world traffic data to identify factors influencing accident severity and built a predictive model using Random Forest.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Machine learning model for severity prediction
- Visualization of key factors using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Results
Achieved ~85â€“90% prediction accuracy for accident severity classification.
